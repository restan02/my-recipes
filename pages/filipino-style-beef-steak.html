    <h1>Filipino Style Beef Steak Recipe</h1>
    <p>Without question, one of the best things about Filipino food is how perfectly it can pair with a heaping cup of rice. Our favorite national carb, many of our meals simply wouldn’t be complete without it! The humble white rice is almost always a go-to companion for several classic Filipino dishes, and this comes as no surprise given how great and adaptable a companion it is. With dishes like ours that are almost always saucy and flavorful, rice easily soaks all those tastes up, making every bite more satisfying. And with this Filipino style beef steak, that’s almost always definitely the case!</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine beef, soy sauce, juice from ½ lemon, and ½ teaspoon cracked peppercorn in a bowl. Mix well. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat cooking oil in a pan. Fry each side of the marinated beef for 1 minute. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Using the remaining oil (you can add more if needed), sauté half of the onion and add the garlic.</li>
            <li>Put the beef in the pan once the onion softens. Sauté for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 ½ cups of water into the pan. Cover and let the liquid boil.</li>
            <li>Add Knorr Beef Cube. Cover the pan and then adjust the heat to a low setting. Cook for up to 40 minutes. Note: add more water as needed.</li>
            <li>Add remaining onion and season with cracked peppercorn and add brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce thicker by pouring-in the slurry. Do this by mixing cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce gets thick enough, you may turn the heat off and transfer your Filipino Style Beef Steak to a serving bowl.</li>
            <li>Serve with warm rice. Share and enjoy!</li>
